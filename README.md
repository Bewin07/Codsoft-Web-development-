### Calculator Project:
The calculator project is a practical implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional tool for basic arithmetic operations. It features a user-friendly interface with buttons for numbers, decimal point, and operators (+, -, *, /). The display screen dynamically updates as users input numbers and perform calculations, enhancing user experience through responsive design and intuitive functionality.

### Portfolio Project:
The portfolio project showcases proficiency in web development with HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript. It includes sections such as a header with name/logo and tagline, an about section with a bio and image, a skills section listing key competencies, a projects section displaying samples of previous work with descriptions and images, a resume section providing a download link for a PDF resume, a contact section with email and phone information, and a footer with copyright notice and additional links.

### Landing Page Project:
A landing page project is designed to attract and engage visitors effectively. It utilizes compelling visuals, concise messaging, and clear call-to-action buttons to encourage user interaction. Key elements typically include a headline that grabs attention, a brief description of the product or service offered, visuals (such as images or videos) that enhance understanding or appeal, a form or button for user engagement (like signing up or exploring more), and social proof elements like testimonials or client logos to build credibility.
